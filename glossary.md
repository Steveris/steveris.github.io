### Containment Division:
The Division that focuses on storing, restraining, potentially suppressing and cataloging anything considered potentially dangerous. This could be potentially dangerous OPs, Entities, or any other Element that may not have a classification.

### Department of Special Affairs:  
A black-budget federal agency tasked with the oversight, integration, containment and potential suppression of anomalous phenomena. Agents operate with federal authority and may use FBI identification during field operations for jurisdictional purposes.

### Division:
The ten branches to which the Department has been divided. These Divisions are: Analytics, Archives, Containment, Executive, Field, Legal, Logistics Infrastructure and Facilities (LIF), Psychological Support Unit (PSU), Relations - Public Interface Division (PID), Research and Development (R&D) and Tactical Response.

### Element:
Any occurrence, object, or entity within the Department's jurisdiction. Includes OPs, Entities, and Anomalies.

### Entity:
An anomalous, non-human, or para-human individual subject to Departmental Jurisdiction. Intelligence, intent, and behaviour vary widely. Subject to integration, containment, or non-interference protocols.

### Executive Division:
The Division that focuses on the management of other Divisions and the operations of the Department at large. The Director and other managers all belong to the Executive Division. Beyond basic management, internal enforcement, and auditing other Departments, the Executive Division also focuses on the bigger picture and is tasked with keeping all operations within the scope of the Department.

### Field Division:
The Division most likely to directly interact with INHs, Anomalies, dangerous OPs in high stress, and complicated environments. They are the boots on the ground, the basic enforcement of laws, and the front line investigators of suspected breaches of law, or anomalous activity. They operate in small teamsbetween two and five Agents, and may have temporary members from the Executive, Analytics, Containment, or Tactical Response.

### Illicit Non-Human (INH):
A classification applied to any Entity that has failed to comply with Department-mandated integration protocols. These Entities often operate without recognition of the Treaty of Disillusionment, or are in direct violation of Departmental statutes. INHs may be formerly registered ICs whose status has been revoked, or entirely unknown Entities discovered through fieldwork or incident reports.

### Integration Candidate (IC):
An Entity approved to live among humans under Departmental oversight. Often registered under Relations Division. Requires regular check-ins and monitoring.

### Legal Division:
The Division that is tasked with interfacing with legal systems when Department activities overlap with systems and laws. Legal is the smallest Department, consisting of 10 Agents with no Division Lead. 5 that specialize in human law that will subcontract additional specialists depending on location of the court, and 5 that specialize in non-human law; some of which will do the same. 

### Logistics, Infrastructure and Facilities (LIF):
The Division focuses on operating, maintaining and supplying Department facilities. Janitorial, basic maintenance, supplies, the cafeteria and many other jobs are run by this Division.

### Non-Element:
Any individual, object, or event considered outside the Department's jurisdiction. Reclassification may occur at any time via Directorial or Interdepartmental Authority.

### Object of Power (OP):
A mundane object exhibiting persistent or situational anomalous traits. Origins unknown. Do not interact with potential OPs without appropriate clearance and suppression tools. Unauthorized interaction may result in disciplinary or medical review.

### Psychological Support Unit (PSU):
Agents within the DSA face high stress and potentially dangerous situations on a daily basis. Within such a high stress environment, there needs to be a Division prioritizes the mental well-being of the DSA's Agents. They track, monitor, study, and provide support for Agents' needs and mental well-being. They also strive for better integration between Human and non-human Agents, seeing it as beneficial for all Agents.

### Realm of Influence (ROI):
The geographic, and metaphysical scope within which the DSA exercises full investigative, regulatory, and enforcement authority.

### Relations - Public Interface Division (PID):


### Research and Development (R&D):


### Tactical Response:


### Treaty of Disillusionment:
The international binding agreement between humanity and the majority of non-human Courts, Alliances, Factions, Covens, and groups. This Treaty requires mutual secrecy, controlled integration, and non-aggression. Violations are to be reported immediately.

### Veil Incident:
Any event in which civilians are exposed to an Element or anomalous activity. Requires immediate response, memory suppression, misinformation deployment, and containment.
