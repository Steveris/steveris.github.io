# Operational Glossary

### Agent:  
An individual formally authorized to act on behalf of the Department. Agents are assigned to one multi-operational branch (SEE: Division).  

### Analytics Division:
Tasked with detecting, tracking, analyzing and coordinating responses to breaches of law, potential threats, anomalous activities, and potential Veil Incidents.

### Anomaly:  
An irregular or spontaneous event, phenomenon, or environmental distortion falling outside accepted physical or metaphysical norms.

### Archives Division:  
The Division tasked with storing, recording, archiving, and studying items assessed as non-hazardous under current classification protocols. This includes ancient tomes, scrolls, manuscripts, tablets, or anything else deemed of relevance that does not pose an immediate threat to those around it.

### Containment Division:
The Division that focuses on storing, restraining, potentially suppressing and cataloging anything considered potentially dangerous. This could be potentially dangerous OPs, Entities, or any other Element that may not have a classification.

### Department of Special Affairs:  
A black-budget federal agency tasked with the oversight, integration, containment and potential suppression of anomalous phenomena. Agents operate with federal authority and may use FBI identification during field operations for jurisdictional purposes.

### Division:
The eleven branches to which the Department has been divided. These Divisions are: Analytics, Archives, Containment, Executive, Field, Legal, Logistics Infrastructure and Facilities (LIF), Psychological Support Unit (PSU), Public Interface Division (PID), Research and Development (R&D) and Tactical Response.

### Element:
Any occurrence, object, or entity within the Department's jurisdiction. Includes OPs, Entities, and Anomalies.

### Entity:
An anomalous, non-human, or para-human individual subject to Departmental Jurisdiction. Intelligence, intent, and behaviour vary widely. Subject to integration, containment, or non-interference protocols.

### Executive Division:
The Division that focuses on the management of other Divisions and the operations of the Department at large. The Director and other managers all belong to the Executive Division. Beyond basic management, internal enforcement, and auditing other Divisions, the Executive Division also focuses on the bigger picture and is tasked with keeping all operations within the scope of the Department.

### Field Division:
The Division most likely to directly interact with INHs, Anomalies, dangerous OPs in high-stress, and complicated environments. They are the boots on the ground, the basic enforcement of laws, and the front line investigators of suspected breaches of law, or anomalous activity. They operate in small teams between two and five Agents, and may have temporary members from the Executive, Analytics, Containment, or Tactical Response.

### Illicit Non-Human (INH):
A classification applied to any Entity that has failed to comply with Department-mandated integration protocols. These Entities often operate without recognition of the Treaty of Disillusionment, or are in direct violation of Departmental statutes. INHs may be formerly registered ICs whose status has been revoked, or entirely unknown Entities discovered through fieldwork or incident reports.

### Integration Candidate (IC):
An Entity approved to live among humans under Departmental oversight. Often registered under Relations Division. Requires regular check-ins and monitoring.

### Legal Division:
The Legal Division interfaces with human and non-human legal systems when Department activities intersect with external jurisdictions. The Division operates without a permanent Division Lead and relies on specialized Agents and contracted experts as required.

### Logistics, Infrastructure and Facilities (LIF):
The Division focuses on operating, maintaining and supplying Department facilities. Janitorial, basic maintenance, supplies, food services and many other jobs are run by this Division.

### Metaphysical Spaces:
Non-Earthbound environments. These are any space beyond Earth that Elements are derived. They vary wildly from the Fey Courts, to various depictions of Hell and the Spirit Realm. (SEE: Field Operations Manual: Metaphysical Spaces).

### Non-Element:
Any individual, object, or event considered outside the Department's jurisdiction. Reclassification may occur at any time via Directorial or Interdepartmental Authority.

### Object of Power (OP):
A mundane object exhibiting persistent or situational anomalous traits. Origins unknown. Do not interact with potential OPs without appropriate clearance and suppression tools. Unauthorized interaction may result in disciplinary or medical review.

### Psychological Support Unit (PSU):
This Division tracks, monitors, studies, and provides support for Agents' mental well-being as mandated by the Executive Division and other Leadership. They also strive for better integration between Human and non-human Agents, seeing it as a baseline requirement for all Agents, and as representative of the Department's goals.

### Public Interface Division (PID):
Occasionally referred to as Relations. This Division focuses on spin, deception, and diplomacy. They negotiate treaties, deals, and alliances with various Entities and organizations. They are also the organization that suppresses, twists, spins, and creates various pieces of media to misinform, desensitize and disillusion the masses. Historical media manipulation campaigns have proven effective in shaping civilian misconceptions regarding various metaphysical and anomalous phenomena.

### Realm of Influence (ROI):
The geographic, and metaphysical scope within which the DSA exercises full investigative, regulatory, and enforcement authority.

### Research and Development (R&D):
This Division studies, analyzes, and researches not only new technology, devices and paracausal capabilities derived from Metaphysical Spaces. It also studies various Elements to aid in the efforts of Field Agents and other teams in the pursuit of the Department's operations and goals.

### Tactical Response:
The paramilitary branch of the Department. When negotiation fails or was never an option, Tactical Response is called in. They are often the last resort, and when deployed they are often working in tandem with Containment to contain the situation. When lives are on the line, and a hyper-aggressive Entity is wreaking havoc, Tactical Response is called to put it down if Containment isn't an option.

### Treaty of Disillusionment:
The international binding agreement between humanity and the majority of non-human Courts, Alliances, Factions, Covens, and groups. This Treaty requires mutual secrecy, controlled integration, and non-aggression. Violations are to be reported immediately.

### Veil Incident:
Any event in which civilians are exposed to an Element or anomalous activity. Requires immediate response, cognitive suppression measures, misinformation deployment, and containment.
