# Entity Taxonomy

## Aberrant
A provisional Entity classification applied to lifeforms that do not conform to any established Departmental taxonomy. These Entities are defined by deviation-exhibiting physiological, behaviorial, or metaphysical irregularities that fall outside known models. Some Aberrants may appear feral or bestial, while others engage in non-random but incomprehensible patterns, suggesting external logic structures or non-human cognition models.

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Noiseforms</td>
      <td>Entities that exhibit semiotic overload-producing or composed of excess symbolic, visual, auditory, or conceptual data. May cause psychological desynchronization in observers including aphasia, pareidolia, intrusive ideation, or non-linear perception. Believed to exist partially outside narrative causality.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chimerics</td>
      <td>Entities composed of disparate biological, symbiotic, or metaphysical subsystems. Often exhibit contradictory anatomical traits. Functional logic may be adaptive, mimetic, or entirely chaotic. Threat level scales with subsystem coherence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Misprints</td>
      <td>Entities that appear as corrupted versions of known biological or cultural templates (e.g. deer with recursive antlers, humanoids with mirrored or textural anomalies). Often feature repeated, stuttered, or "glitched" behavior. May suggest failed attempts at mimetic integration or baseline reality. Low-level memetic hazard common.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Negatives</td>
      <td>Aberrants defined not by what they are, but what they are not. These include absence-shaped entities, anti-patterns, or zones of metaphysical negation. May erase memory, matter, or energy in localized areas. Some exhibit topological impossibilities or dimensional bleed. Field containment discouraged.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ontological Divergents</td>
      <td>An entity that seems somewhat similar to one or more creatures of Earth, usually with some metaphysical enhancements or combinations of traits without being a disparate combinate like Chimerics. These are entities that make sense in the given Metaphysical Space they originate, but their taxonomy defies the other categories.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</details>

## Amorphous
Entities lacking fixed anatomical structure. Often fluidic, gelatinous, or mutable in form. Amorphous entities do not rely on skeletal or rigid frameworks for movement or interaction. While many are composed of biolgocail or pseudo-biological material (e.g. slime, protoplasm, ecto-organic matter), some derive from nonstandard states of matter such as phase-fluidic plasma, quantum foam or metaphysical residue.

      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gelid Masses</td>
      <td>Slimes or oozes. Often found in subterranean spaces. Capable of rapid cellular regeneration and nutrient absorption. These are typically ambush predators, either sticking to ceilings, invisibly filling the walls of a hallway, or camouflaging with a grimy floor until prey unwittingly falls into its ambush.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Neural Plasmoids</td>
      <td>Amorphous entities comprised of pseudoneural tissue or psionic fluid. Exhibits thought-eating behaviour, often absorbs and replicates surface level memories or emotions from prey. Prolonged exposure can cause identity erosion, false memory implantation, or dream bleed. In rare cases, personnel have imprinted upon such entities, resulting in partial symbiosis or psychic dependency.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cyst Entities</td>
      <td>Organically self contained masses that grow from ruptured biological or conceptual barriers. Often begin as small lumps but rapidly accumulate mass. Unchecked cysts may "birth" secondary organisms, appendages, or entirely new Entities. Rare cases suggest they act as incubators or other interstitial lifeforms.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mycomorphs</td>
      <td>Fungal fluid hybrids with a decentralized nervous system. Spread via spores that form smal bloblets when moistened. Exhibit slow teritorial expansion and collective intelligence. Known to create bioluminescent signals in ritualistic patterns. Not always hostile; some subtypes maintain defensive symbiosis with cryptoflora or Thresholders.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</details>

## Artificial
Entities intentionally or accidentally created through non-natural means, typically by sapient intervention (magical, technological, or alchemical). Artificial entities are defined by their constructed nature; whether their form, function, or consciousness originates from deliberate design or emergent self-assembly. Their intelligence ranges from rudimentary automation to sapient, emotionally complex minds.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Egoarts (OPs with consciousness)</td>
      <td>OPs that have developed or been embedded with self-awareness. They blur the line between Entity and OP. May have originated as non-sapient OPs but gained consciousness through prolonged human interaction, exposure to MS, or deliberate ritual. Capable of autonomous decision-making, emotional response, or manipulation of bonded users. Egoarts may shift form, function or alignment based on relationship with wielder. Some are cooperative; others parasitic, domineering, or unpredictable. Containment protocols require psychological screening of users and symbolic neutralization.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Golems</td>
      <td>Traditional element-bound constructs formed from clay, stone, metal, or rare materials, animated through sacred or structured language. Often tasked with protection or punishment. Emotionally inert but unyielding.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</details>

## Celestial
Seemingly benevolent or neutral metaphysical beings often interpreted as angels, spirits, or divine intermediaries. These "spirits" are not connected to the Spirit Realm or death. Frequently reported as emanating from "higher planes" or paradisiacal Metaphysical Spaces (MS), though confirmed connections between these MS and known theological heavens are unverified or contradictory. Not always aligned with human values.

## Cryptid
Cryptids are biologically anomalous entities typically located in remote, liminal, or topologically unstable regions. Their origins vary; some are relics of extinct species preserved in cryptotemporal anomalies or time dilated Metaphysical Spaces (MS), others are emergent bioforms shaped by prolonged anomalous exposure, or entirely undocumented evolution outside known phylogenetic trees. The majority are regionally bound, with their activity often (but not always) correlating to Class-Gate Anomalies.

    <tr>
      <td>Sasquatch-Class Hominids</td>
      <td>Bipedal, large-frame primates of unknown origin. Generally non-aggressive unless provoked. Capable of tool use, rudimentary structures, and coordinated evasion of detection.

    <tr>
      <td>Sky Beasts (Rods, Atmospheric Megafauna, Cloud Predators</td>
      <td>Entities exhisting primarily at high altitudes or within dense cloud formations. Often invisible to unaided eye, visible only on slow-frame video or post-event spectral analysis. Flight patterns defy known aerodynamics. Some feed on EM radiation or static buildup from storms. Behavioral patterns unclear; may follow aircraft or congregate during high-altitude metaphysical activity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tunnel Men</td>
      <td>Pale subterranean humanoids reported in mining collapses, forgotten bunkers, or abandoned urban infrastructure. Avoid light and contact; exhibit pack coordination and mimicry of human speech patterns. Some appear to interact with collapsed human societies or bio-echoes. Disputed classification.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Herald Cryptids (Mothman, Black Bird of Chernobyl, Owlman)</td>
      <td>Entities reported shortly before major disasters, structural collapses, or mass-fatality events. Appearances often limited to liminal hours (dusk/dawn) and accompanied by heightened electromagnetic readings, disorientation, or overwhelming dread. Behavior is non-aggression but persistently observed near sites of imminent catastrophe. Purpose unclear; may function as metaphysical omens, passive anomaly detectors, or precursors to larger unrevealed systems of fate-based anomalies.</td>
    </tr>

</details>

## Cryptoflora
Plant-like organisms that exhibit anomalous or metaphysical properties inconsistent with known biology or ecological laws. Origins range from MS exposure events, mutation via anomaly contact, extradimensional seedfall, failed biogenesis rituals, or adaptive evolutoni in ontologically unstable regions. Unlike standard flora, Cryptoflora may display locomotion, cognition, interdimensional phasing, or non-terrestrial metabolic processes (e.g. feeding on emotion, memory, sound, or concepts).

    <tr>
      <td>Mycognostics</td>
      <td>Fungal cryptoflora with psionic spores disphersal networks. Capable of transmitting thoughts, dreams, and memories between infected hosts. Some strain induce hive-mind behavior or ritualistic hallucinations. Known to coordinate with other anomaly types, including High Concepts.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Resonant Growths</td>
      <td>Plants whose growth rates and patterns correlate to local frequencies: electromagnetic, emotional, linguistic or memetic. Can "tune" themselves to surveillance equipment, prayers, or recurring local thoughts. Overexposure can result in harmonic infections.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Petragardeners</td>
      <td>Slow-moving, lichen-like colonies that transform surrounding terrain into anomalous mineral formations. Often mistaken for geological events until late-stage terraforming is underway. Some variants terraform human structures or bodies into habitat zones.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mimic Bloom</td>
      <td>Appear identical to native flora, but function as psychic siphons, drawing emotional content or personality fragments. Victims display personality degradation over time. Long-term exposure may result in complete conceptual ossification: "living statues" of identity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Photosophonts</td>
      <td>Rare sentient plants or colonies capable of limited telepathic communication. Often philosophically obsessed, fixated on cycles, death, or entropy. May offer riddles, guidance, or dangerous metaphysical insight. Typically immobile, but attract pilgrims, dreamers, or host-seekers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Verdantheric Root Masses</td>
      <td>Extremely old, slow thinking cryptoflora that integrate with local history or trauma. Tend to create stable microclimates with altered time flow. Cutting into root systems may result in historical bleed (e.g. voices of the dead, lost languages, repeating events).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Thorns of Retraction</td>
      <td>Defensive cryptoflora that phase in and out of reality, appearing only when approached. Function as anti-pursuit barriers, often appearing in MS-bound corridors or during escape events. Contact causes memory fragmentation or identity recursion.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Soulseed Pods</td>
      <td>Carry the psychic imprint of the area where they were formed. Some contain latent avatars or "echoes" of the dead. Sprouting a pod may result in manifestation of full memory-constructs, temporary temporal layering, or reanimatoin of local anomalies.</td>
    </tr>

## Dragon
Ancient, sapient NHEs associated with dominance, accumulation, strategic manipulation, and long-term influence. Dragons do not simply hoard material wealth: they accumulate *significance*. Despite their ancient legacy, most Dragons today are undocumented Illicit Non-Humans (INHs), their numbers diminished by the historical Saint George Campaign (11th-13th Century CE). Surviving Dragons operate via embedded personas, shell conglomerates, arcane cults, or digital proxies, exercising influence across human systems while keeping their true nature hidden.

      <td>Asian</td>
      <td>Long-bodied, serpentine, and wingless. Asian Dragons possess a strong affinity for water or sky, and dreams.

Several Integration Candidates (ICs) exist under Departmental observation; a significantly larger hidden population is suspected to operate as INHs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>African</td>
      <td>Regarded by some scholars as the oldest extant Dragon lineage, African Dragons often concern themselves with traditional tribal territories, not the borders established by former European conquerers. They rarely seek integration, but do not attempt to hide as thoroughly as their Asian counterparts. Some show cooperative behavior when approached by DSA and their international allies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Spectral (Spiritus Draconis)</td>
    <td>Echoes, ghosts, or memory-patterns of Dragons slain in metaphysically traumatic ways. Frequently (but not always) attaches to powerful human individuals, especially those with compulsive acquisitive behavior. Though whether this behavior is due to the Spiritus Draconis, or was what attracted the possession, it is unclear. Manifestation almost always occurs without the host's awareness. Influences decision-making, exacerbates hoarding.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</details>

## Elemental
A classification of Entities typically originating from strongly elementally attuned Metaphysical Spaces (MS). Elementals may arise naturally within these environments or be artificially summoned, constructed, or bound by Para-Humans, NHEs, or other metaphysically capable actors. While many Elementals demonstrate limited cognition and operate primarily on instinctual programming, rare instances exhibit autonomous reasoning, behavioral learning, or linguistic mimicry.

    <tr>
      <td>High Concept Elementals</td>
      <td>Rare class of Elementals formed around abstract, symbolic, or emotional constructs (e.g., pain, memory, decay, silence). Typically exhibit partial incorporeality and unpredictable behavior. Containment remains provisional in most cases.<br>See: <b>High Concept</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Synthetic Elementals</td>
      <td>Artificially constructed metaphysical constructs developed through ritual, sigil binding, or OP assisted formation. Their stability varies depending on binding matrix and source material.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</details>

## Energy Being
Incorporeal or semi-corporeal entities composed primarily of energetic phenomena: light, shadow, electricity, psychospiritual resonance, or elemental radiation. Most originate from high-energy Metaphysical Spaces (MS), including elemental planes, energy dominant realms, or the Spirit Realm. Though often labeled "spectral", many possess mass-variable or selectively tangible forms. Their interactions with the physical world typically involve resonance, manifestation, or possession.

  </table>
</details>

## Fey
Metaphysical entities whose folklore predates recorded civilization. Fey vary wildly in shape, motive, and demeanor: ranging from child-snatching predators to capricious tricksters. Most originate from Metaphysical Spaces that are part of, or adjacent to, vast networks often called the Seelie Courts or similar mythic structures. Others, while exhibiting ey-like behavior or biology, are unrelated to these lineages. Fey often interact with reality through symbolic logic.  
Caution is advised.
