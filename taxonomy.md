# Entity Taxonomy

## Aberrant
A provisional Entity classification applied to lifeforms that do not conform to any established Departmental taxonomy. These Entities are defined by deviation-exhibiting physiological, behaviorial, or metaphysical irregularities that fall outside known models. Some Aberrants may appear feral or bestial, while others engage in non-random but incomprehensible patterns, suggesting external logic structures or non-human cognition models.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Noiseforms</td>
      <td>Entities that exhibit semiotic overload-producing or composed of excess symbolic, visual, auditory, or conceptual data. May cause psychological desynchronization in observers including aphasia, pareidolia, intrusive ideation, or non-linear perception. Believed to exist partially outside narrative causality.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chimerics</td>
      <td>Entities composed of disparate biological, symbiotic, or metaphysical subsystems. Often exhibit contradictory anatomical traits. Functional logic may be adaptive, mimetic, or entirely chaotic. Threat level scales with subsystem coherence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Misprints</td>
      <td>Entities that appear as corrupted versions of known biological or cultural templates (e.g. deer with recursive antlers, humanoids with mirrored or textural anomalies). Often feature repeated, stuttered, or "glitched" behavior. May suggest failed attempts at mimetic integration or baseline reality. Low-level memetic hazard common.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Negatives</td>
      <td>Aberrants defined not by what they are, but what they are not. These include absence-shaped entities, anti-patterns, or zones of metaphysical negation. May erase memory, matter, or energy in localized areas. Some exhibit topological impossibilities or dimensional bleed. Field containment discouraged.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ontological Divergents</td>
      <td>An entity that seems somewhat similar to one or more creatures of Earth, usually with some metaphysical enhancements or combinations of traits without being a disparate combinate like Chimerics. These are entities that make sense in the given Metaphysical Space they originate, but their taxonomy defies the other categories.</td>
