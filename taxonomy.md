# Entity Taxonomy

## Aberrant
A provisional Entity classification applied to lifeforms that do not conform to any established Departmental taxonomy. These Entities are defined by deviation-exhibiting physiological, behaviorial, or metaphysical irregularities that fall outside known models. Some Aberrants may appear feral or bestial, while others engage in non-random but incomprehensible patterns, suggesting external logic structures or non-human cognition models.

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Noiseforms</td>
      <td>Entities that exhibit semiotic overload-producing or composed of excess symbolic, visual, auditory, or conceptual data. May cause psychological desynchronization in observers including aphasia, pareidolia, intrusive ideation, or non-linear perception. Believed to exist partially outside narrative causality.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chimerics</td>
      <td>Entities composed of disparate biological, symbiotic, or metaphysical subsystems. Often exhibit contradictory anatomical traits. Functional logic may be adaptive, mimetic, or entirely chaotic. Threat level scales with subsystem coherence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Misprints</td>
      <td>Entities that appear as corrupted versions of known biological or cultural templates (e.g. deer with recursive antlers, humanoids with mirrored or textural anomalies). Often feature repeated, stuttered, or "glitched" behavior. May suggest failed attempts at mimetic integration or baseline reality. Low-level memetic hazard common.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Negatives</td>
      <td>Aberrants defined not by what they are, but what they are not. These include absence-shaped entities, anti-patterns, or zones of metaphysical negation. May erase memory, matter, or energy in localized areas. Some exhibit topological impossibilities or dimensional bleed. Field containment discouraged.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ontological Divergents</td>
      <td>An entity that seems somewhat similar to one or more creatures of Earth, usually with some metaphysical enhancements or combinations of traits without being a disparate combinate like Chimerics. These are entities that make sense in the given Metaphysical Space they originate, but their taxonomy defies the other categories.</td>
    </tr>

## Amorphous
Entities lacking fixed anatomical structure. Often fluidic, gelatinous, or mutable in form. Amorphous entities do not rely on skeletal or rigid frameworks for movement or interaction. While many are composed of biolgocail or pseudo-biological material (e.g. slime, protoplasm, ecto-organic matter), some derive from nonstandard states of matter such as phase-fluidic plasma, quantum foam or metaphysical residue.

  <table>
     <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gelid Masses</td>
      <td>Slimes or oozes. Often found in subterranean spaces. Capable of rapid cellular regeneration and nutrient absorption. These are typically ambush predators, either sticking to ceilings, invisibly filling the walls of a hallway, or camouflaging with a grimy floor until prey unwittingly falls into its ambush.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Neural Plasmoids</td>
      <td>Amorphous entities comprised of pseudoneural tissue or psionic fluid. Exhibits thought-eating behaviour, often absorbs and replicates surface level memories or emotions from prey. Prolonged exposure can cause identity erosion, false memory implantation, or dream bleed. In rare cases, personnel have imprinted upon such entities, resulting in partial symbiosis or psychic dependency.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cyst Entities</td>
      <td>Organically self contained masses that grow from ruptured biological or conceptual barriers. Often begin as small lumps but rapidly accumulate mass. Unchecked cysts may "birth" secondary organisms, appendages, or entirely new Entities. Rare cases suggest they act as incubators or other interstitial lifeforms.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mycomorphs</td>
      <td>Fungal fluid hybrids with a decentralized nervous system. Spread via spores that form smal bloblets when moistened. Exhibit slow teritorial expansion and collective intelligence. Known to create bioluminescent signals in ritualistic patterns. Not always hostile; some subtypes maintain defensive symbiosis with cryptoflora or Thresholders.</td>
    </tr>

## Artificial
Entities intentionally or accidentally created through non-natural means, typically by sapient intervention (magical, technological, or alchemical). Artificial entities are defined by their constructed nature; whether their form, function, or consciousness originates from deliberate design or emergent self-assembly. Their intelligence ranges from rudimentary automation to sapient, emotionally complex minds.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Constructs</td>
      <td>Mechanically or magically animated devices, often created to serve a specific function (guard, labor, surveillance). Behavior ranges from simple programming to limited adaptive logic. Vulnerabilities depend on power source and construction material.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Homunculi</td>
      <td>Alchemically synthesized humanoids, typically created to act as familiars, assistants, or proxy bodies. Intelligence varries; some exhibit childlike minds, others mimic full adult cognition. Prone to identity crises, emotional instability, or rebellion if exposed to trauma or extended separation from creator.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Egoarts (OPs with consciousness)</td>
      <td>OPs that have developed or been embedded with self-awareness. They blur the line between Entity and OP. May have originated as non-sapient OPs but gained consciousness through prolonged human interaction, exposure to MS, or deliberate ritual. Capable of autonomous decision-making, emotional response, or manipulation of bonded users. Egoarts may shift form, function or alignment based on relationship with wielder. Some are cooperative; others parasitic, domineering, or unpredictable. Containment protocols require psychological screening of users and symbolic neutralization.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Golems</td>
      <td>Traditional element-bound constructs formed from clay, stone, metal, or rare materials, animated through sacred or structured language. Often tasked with protection or punishment. Emotionally inert but unyielding.</td>
