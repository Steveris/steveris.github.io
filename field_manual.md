# Field Operations Manual

> **Subject**: Field Operations Manual
> **Clearance Level**: Field Operative - Provisional
> **Department of Special Affairs (DSA)**
> **Issuing Officer**: Senior Agent D. Voltaire, Field Operations
> **Date**: 01/01/1989

This manual constitutes the official Field Guide for all Provisional and Active Field operatives of the Department of Special Affairs. It is a restricted-access resource compiled to assist Field Agents in the identification, classification, and safe engagement of anomalous phenomena, hereafter referred to as Elements.

This guide is intended as a field-reference supplement, not a comprehensive database. The anomalous remains, by definition, volatile and incompletely understood. New classifications, emergent phenomena, and updated protocols are diseminated periodically via encrypted dispatch. Operatives are expected to remain current.
