# Elemental Classification
This section of the Field Operations Manual provides foundational reference material for the identification, categorization, and potential operating procedure of all known Elements under Department jurisdiction. General information on Containment methodology is also included in this section. Field Agents are required to review classification updates monthly and immediately report any unregistered Element encountered within the ROI.
