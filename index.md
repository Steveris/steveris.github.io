Congratulations on your formal introduction into the **Department of Special Affairs (DSA)**. Your clearance has been verified, and you are now authorized to access **Tier-3 internal documents**, including this manual. Access is strictly restricted to on-premise use within Department facilities. All information in this document is classified **Top Secret - Eyes Only**.

    <b>UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, DISTRIBUTION, OR STORAGE OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE</b>

  Violations will result in immediate termination of employment, revocation of clearance, federal prosecution under Title 18, and/or countermeasures as deemed appropriate by the <b>Directorate of Integration and Oversight</b>.

## Your Mission  
As a Field Agent, you will be tasked with the investigation, containment, and regulation of **Elements** that present an anomalous deviation from accepted natural law. These include- but are not limited to- **Entities**, **Anomalies**, and **Objects of Power (OPs)**.  
You will also be responsible for enforcing inter-species law, monitoring supernatural integration, identifying unauthorized arcane practices, and maintaining the ongoing **concealment** of paranormal phenomena from the general public.  
The Department operates under the international agreement via the **Treaty of Disillusionment**, binding recognized non-human Courts and Factions to coexistence protocols. You are expected to honor and enforce this treaty during all field operations.

## Key Principles of Engagement
- **Preservation of Normalcy**: The veil between the mundane world and anomalous truth must be maintained at all costs.
- **Proportional Response**: Not all **Elements** are hostile. Do not escalate without just cause. Lethal force is a last resort and must be documented in full before being submitted to a formal review.
- **Enforcement of Law**: All **Elements**- whether recognized as **Integration Candidates (ICs)**, or classified as **Illicit Non-Humans (INHs)**- fall under Departmental jurisdiction when operating within the Department's **Realm of Influence (ROI)**. Agents are authorized to detain, investigate, or neutralize any **Element** in violation of applicable interspecies or local law, supernatural containment statues, or the **Treaty of Disillusionment**.
