You have been formally inducted into the **Department of Special Affairs (DSA)**.

## Your Mission  
As a [Field](glossary.html#field) [Agent](glossary.html#agent), you will be tasked with the investigation, containment, and regulation of **Elements** that present an anomalous deviation from accepted natural or metaphysical law. These include, but are not limited to **Entities**, **Anomalies**, and **Objects of Power (OPs)**.  
Field Agents are responsible for enforcement of Treaty obligations, monitoring Entity integration, identifying unauthorized arcane practices, and maintaining the ongoing **concealment** of anomalous phenomena from public awareness.  
The Department operates pursuant to the **Treaty of Disillusionment**. Field Agents shall comply with all enforcement, mediation, and reporting obligations arising under the Treaty during field operations.

  <b>"Anomaly is not Immunity. Magic does not place one above the law."</b><br>

## Key Principles of Engagement
- **Preservation of Normalcy**: The veil between the mundane world and anomalous truth must be maintained under all operational circumstances.
- **Proportional Response**: Not all **Elements** are hostile. Do not escalate without just cause. Lethal force is a last resort and must be fully documented and submitted for formal review by the Executive Division.
- **Enforcement of Law**: All **Elements**, including recognized **Integration Candidates (ICs)**, and classified as **Illicit Non-Humans (INHs)**, fall under Departmental jurisdiction when operating within the Department's **Realm of Influence (ROI)**. Agents are authorized to detain, investigate, or neutralize any **Element** in violation of applicable interspecies law, local law, containment statutes, or the **Treaty of Disillusionment**.
